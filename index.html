                            <h2>Gift-a-Book Marketing Campaign</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Enactus UTSC's 2015 Book Drive</p>
                            <p>The Gift-a-Book drive was the very first project that I worked on for Enactus; I proposed the idea to launch a charity event during the Fall term around November until the end of the term. Our team had been fairly inactive during the Fall and we needed something to get our club noticed by students.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/books.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Initially, I started off our marketing by copying everyone else - making Facebook posts, tweeting, and ensuring that we had enough promotional materials during our tabling hours. We had a raffle for students who donated books as well. However, as time went on, we needed more exposure. So I pushed for the promotion of this project; we needed more students to know about our event, not just from social media, but we needed word-of-mouth. This was achieved by having members of our team go to various classrooms and lecture halls to make announcements at the beginning of each class to inform students across the campus about our book drive.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the term, we had collected over 400 books and we donated them to the local community - the children's and teen's books were given to the Highland Creek Public School, the young adult books were given to an organization called <i>Our Place Our Community</i>, and the remaining books were donated to the <i>Salvation Army.</i></p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Social Media, Graphic Design, Branding</p>
                            <p>From 2015 to 2016, I was responsible for Enactus UTSC's marketing department. Starting off, I received very little training and guidance as to how to operate the marketing department. However, I experimented and tried several things throughout the summer (while the term was quieter) to test things for the upcoming school term. I decided the majority of our marketing would focus on improving our social media presence, and to orient our events and projects to be more attractive to business students.</p>
                            <p>By reviewing the other business club's social media and analyzing the different social media channels they had, I decided to set up a Twitter account for Enactus UTSC. I also hired a social media associate to assist with developing posts related to entrepreneurship and innovation to keep the page more active when we had less events going on.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/photoshop.jpeg" alt="">                            
                            <p>In order to attract more attention for our social media posts, I created visuals that would generate more interest for viewers. I frequently used Adobe Photoshop to create graphics to make our posts more appealing and to include additional information, rather than having a text-heavy post. As a result of the frequent social media posts and graphics, our Facebook post engagements increaased by 137% during the year.</p>
                            <p>Finally, another aspect of what I focused on for Enactus UTSC during the year was to establish a stronger brand presence. This was done through planning our events and projects around Enactus' core values. Furthermore, our social media posts reinforce Enactus' dedication to community development and entrepreneurship, and how our events and projects relate to those values.</p>

                            <p>Enactus UTSC regularly attentds the annual Regionals Exposition and National Exposition. Every year, our team competes on a regional level against other schools in Eastern Canada, and on a national level against all Enactus chapters in Canada. At these competitions, we showcase our projects. This past year we presented Financing Futures at the Regionals Exposition, and at the Nationals Exposition, we presented our two other large projects, SAAAC Creatives and Consultpreneur.</p>
                            <p>For the Regionals and Nationals Expositions, I was responsible for developing the presentations and reviewing the scripts for our competition's team. These competitions are always hectic - from creating the presentations, to the actual presentation day. So many things can go wrong (and they have), but as a team we were always able to work around those issues together.</p>
